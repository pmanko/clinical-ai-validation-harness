# Specification Quality Checklist: Validation Run Reporting Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Q1 resolved: the spec ABSORBS both in-flight efforts into one unified app — catalog/homepage curation (US2 / FR-016) and human review/adjudication (US3 / FR-017–019). The `feat/editable-reports-homepage` and `feat/report-human-feedback` worktrees fold into this workstream and should be reconciled/migrated, not double-built.
- All quality items pass.
